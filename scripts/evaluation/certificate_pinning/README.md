# Certificate Pinning

Certificate pinning evaluation scripts based on the results obtained by the [static analysis](https://github.com/NEU-SNS/app-tls-pinning/tree/main/code/certificate-pinning/StaticAnalysis) from [Pradeep et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517745.3561439).


## Download Date

The table shows information about the publishing dates of randomly selected apps from the IoTProfiler and Neupane et al.. We obtained the version codes from the respective app Manifests. Based on them, we searched for the publishing date on [Apkpure](https://apkpure.com/), a third-party market. We decided to use Apkpures, as no historical data on the Play Store is available, and app pages are infrequently archived. Additionally, the table includes the release date of the version after the one in the dataset, and the archived links to Apkpure version pages. For IoTSpotter apps, the download date is available as they were downloaded via [Androzoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu/).
